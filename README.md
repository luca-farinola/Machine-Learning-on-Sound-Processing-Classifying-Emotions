<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We have used the AC model to explor speech recognition. In particular we have used  

Bird eye view of the project:
* Differential expression analysis with limma 
* Co-epression  Network
* Switch Miner algorithm
  
Switch Miner algorithm is described in the following article : 

<!-- DATA -->
### Data
Data directory is needed to run the files. Those data include gene expression count data, 
metadata with patient information, gene lenght for FPKM normalizzation. Those data are uploaded in zenodo at link below.
